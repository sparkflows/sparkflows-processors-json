  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The primary objective of the Demand-Forecasting-CPG project is to accurately predict future product demand at the store-item level using historical transaction data. This forecasting capability is aimed at solving critical business challenges such as inventory optimization, reducing stockouts, minimizing overstock, and enabling data-driven replenishment strategies. Specifically, the project addresses the question:</p><p> “How much of each item should be stocked in each store at a given time to meet customer demand while minimizing costs?”</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The methodology follows a standard data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Collection &amp; Understanding – Analyze the transaction dataset to identify key dimensions (date, store, item, sales).</li><li>Data Preparation – Clean the dataset, engineer time-series features, and handle anomalies or missing values.</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Profile sales trends, seasonality, and store/item-level performance.</li><li>Model Development – Apply time-series forecasting and machine learning approaches (ARIMA, Prophet, or advanced models like XGBoost and LSTMs).</li><li>Model Evaluation – Assess model accuracy using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and MAE.</li><li>Deployment – Integrate the chosen model into an analytical or web application for continuous demand forecasting.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Accurate demand forecasting is critical in the CPG industry due to:</p><ul><li>Fluctuating consumer demand patterns.</li><li>Seasonal and promotional effects.</li><li>The need to balance availability with operational costs.</li><li> This project enables data-driven decision-making for supply chain management, ensuring the right product is available at the right time and place.</li></ul><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Reduced inventory carrying costs and minimized lost sales from stockouts.</li><li>Operational: Optimized distribution and replenishment schedules.</li><li>Strategic: Improved customer satisfaction and competitive advantage through better service levels.</li><li>Analytical: Enhanced understanding of demand drivers across stores and items.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>A robust forecasting model capable of predicting daily/weekly sales at the store-item level.</li><li>Improved forecast accuracy by at least 10–15% compared to traditional heuristic-based planning.</li><li>An integrated dashboard or reporting system to visualize demand trends.</li><li>Actionable insights into demand drivers and seasonality patterns.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
