  "content": "<h2>Project Overview</h2><h3>Objective</h3><p>The primary objective of the Store-Segmentation project is to classify and group retail stores based on their sales performance, customer demographics, location attributes, and product purchase preferences. This segmentation will allow the business to design tailored strategies for each group of stores, improving marketing efficiency, optimizing supply chain operations, and enhancing customer satisfaction.</p><p>The key business problem being addressed is:</p><ul><li>How can we identify clusters of stores with similar behavior and characteristics?</li><li>How can these clusters be used to inform pricing, promotions, inventory allocation, and product assortment decisions?</li></ul><h3>Approach</h3><p>The project follows a standard data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Collection &amp; Integration: Utilize customer invoice data and product mapping data as the foundation.</li><li>Data Preparation: Perform data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment (e.g., aggregating customer behavior, mapping product categories).</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key trends, patterns, and anomalies within sales and store data.</li><li>Feature Engineering: Construct features such as average basket size, revenue per customer, product category shares, and seasonality indicators.</li><li>Modeling (Segmentation): Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models) to group stores.</li><li>Validation &amp; Interpretation: Evaluate the stability and interpretability of clusters, and profile them with respect to business outcomes.</li><li>Deployment: Make results accessible via a web-based dashboard for business teams.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Store segmentation provides a structured way to understand heterogeneity across the retail network. Instead of treating all stores equally, the business gains a lens to:</p><ul><li>Personalize promotions and pricing strategies.</li><li>Allocate resources effectively (inventory, sales reps, campaigns).</li><li>Identify high-performing stores and replicate their strategies across similar segments.</li></ul><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Increased revenue through targeted marketing and optimized inventory allocation.</li><li>Operational: Improved stock planning and reduced supply chain inefficiencies.</li><li>Strategic: Stronger market positioning and differentiated customer experience per store cluster.</li><li>Analytical: Enhanced ability to track store performance across meaningful peer groups.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Segmentation of all stores into 3–7 distinct clusters based on sales, customer, and product characteristics.</li><li>Store-level profiles with descriptive insights (e.g., “Value-focused urban stores”, “Premium high-footfall stores”).</li><li>Recommendations for assortment planning, promotions, and replenishment strategy per cluster.</li><li>Deployment of dashboards for ongoing monitoring and reporting.</li></ul>",
