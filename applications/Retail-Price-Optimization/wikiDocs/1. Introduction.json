  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The primary goal of this project is to optimize product pricing in a retail environment by leveraging historical sales, competitor pricing, promotional activities, and advertising spend. The key business question being addressed is:</p><p>\"What is the optimal price point for each product that maximizes sales volume and revenue while maintaining competitiveness in the market?\"</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The methodology follows a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Profiling &amp; Cleaning – Assess data quality, handle missing values, and standardize formats.</li><li>Feature Engineering – Create derived variables (e.g., log transformations, competitor minimum price, promotion indicators).</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends, correlations, and price elasticity patterns.</li><li>Model Development – Train regression-based and machine learning models to quantify price elasticity and predict sales volumes.</li><li>Evaluation &amp; Optimization – Evaluate models using statistical and predictive metrics, then simulate different pricing scenarios to find the optimal strategy.</li><li>Deployment – Package insights into a web/analytical application for business decision-makers.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Price is one of the most powerful levers in retail strategy. Even a small price change can have a disproportionate impact on sales volume, revenue, and market share. By using data-driven pricing models, the business can move away from intuition-based decisions and adopt a scientific approach to maximize profitability.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Increase revenue and profitability by identifying the most effective pricing strategies.</li><li>Operational: Improve promotional planning and advertising budget allocation.</li><li>Strategic: Gain a competitive edge by responding quickly to competitor price changes.</li><li>Customer-Centric: Align product affordability with customer demand and purchasing behavior.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>A predictive model that estimates sales volume based on product price and market conditions.</li><li>Elasticity insights for each product and size category.</li><li>A pricing recommendation engine integrated into the analytical/web application.</li><li>Visualizations of competitor pricing trends and sales response curves.</li></ul>",
