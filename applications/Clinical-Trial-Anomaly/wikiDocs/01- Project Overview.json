  "content": "<h2>Project Overview</h2><h3>Objective:</h3><p> The Clinical-Trial-Anomaly project is designed to empower clinical data managers, CRAs, and biostatisticians to detect anomalies and deviations in clinical trial datasets. The primary goal is to leverage historical and ongoing clinical trial data to identify irregularities in patient responses, treatment adherence, and data entries, thereby improving trial data quality and reducing the risk of protocol violations or regulatory submission issues.</p><h3>Approach:</h3><p> The workflow of the application includes:</p><ol><li>Data Acquisition: Load clinical trial datasets and any previously trained anomaly detection models.</li><li>Data Preparation: Clean, transform, and encode patient, treatment, and outcome data for modeling.</li><li>Anomaly Detection: Apply machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms to uncover unusual patterns or deviations.</li><li>Evaluation &amp; Validation: Assess the accuracy of anomaly detection using historical labeled anomalies or expert review.</li><li>Visualization &amp; Reporting: Generate dashboards and summary tables highlighting flagged data points, anomaly scores, and anomaly types by variable, subject, and visit.</li></ol><h3>Significance:</h3><p> The application is valuable because it:</p><ul><li>Enhances trial data quality and regulatory compliance.</li><li>Reduces the need for manual review of large datasets.</li><li>Allows early detection of protocol deviations, minimizing potential delays or submission rejections.</li></ul><h3>Benefits:</h3><ul><li>Improved data quality monitoring through automated anomaly detection.</li><li>Reduced protocol deviations and associated regulatory risk.</li><li>Accelerated query resolution workflows via early detection of anomalies.</li><li>Better decision-making with dashboards and ready-made reports for clinical teams.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes:</h3><ul><li>Summary tables of flagged anomalies at subject, visit, and variable levels.</li><li>Anomaly scores and classifications per data point.</li><li>Improved operational efficiency for clinical data monitoring teams.</li><li>Actionable insights to prevent data inconsistencies and enhance patient safety.</li></ul>",
