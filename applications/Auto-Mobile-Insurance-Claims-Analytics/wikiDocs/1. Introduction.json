The project focuses on analyzing, predicting, and detecting anomalies in automobile insurance claims data, helping insurance companies optimize operations, reduce fraudulent claims, and better assess risks.</p><p>The project involves processing two primary datasets: <strong>insurance claims data</strong> and <strong>insurance policies data</strong>. These datasets contain critical information about claim incidents, policy details, claim amounts, suspicious activities, and customer demographics. By leveraging this data, the goal is to develop a predictive model to classify claims, detect fraud, and improve decision-making processes for underwriters.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>Key Objectives :</strong></h2><h3>1. <strong>Fraud Detection</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Develop a classification model to predict whether a claim is fraudulent (based on the <code>suspicious_activity</code> flag).</li><li><strong>Approach</strong>: Use supervised machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to classify claims based on the available data (e.g., claim amounts, incident severity, number of witnesses).</li><li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC will be used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.</li></ul><h3>2. <strong>Risk Assessment</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Estimate the likelihood of a claim leading to high payouts.</li><li><strong>Approach</strong>: Analyze historical claim data to predict claim severity and total claim amounts. Regression techniques will be applied to predict claim payouts.</li><li><strong>Metrics</strong>: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared will assess the accuracy of the predictions.</li></ul><h3>3. <strong>Customer Insights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Objective</strong>: Provide insights into customer behavior and policy characteristics that lead to frequent claims or fraudulent activities.</li><li><strong>Approach</strong>: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends related to customer demographics (e.g., age, relationship to insured) and policy details.</li><li><strong>Visualizations</strong>: Histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices will be used to explore relationships between variables.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
