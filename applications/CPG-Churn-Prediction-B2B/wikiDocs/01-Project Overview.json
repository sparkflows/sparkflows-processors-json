  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The primary goal of the CPG-Churn-Prediction-B2B project is to identify and predict potential customer churn within distributor–customer relationships in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) sector. Churn prediction enables businesses to proactively engage with at-risk customers, strengthen long-term relationships, and reduce revenue loss caused by customer attrition. By leveraging transactional, product, customer, and distributor data, this project aims to build a predictive model that flags customers likely to stop or reduce purchasing activity in the near future.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The project follows a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Ingestion &amp; Integration — Collecting and merging transactional, customer, product, and distributor datasets.</li><li>Data Profiling &amp; Cleaning — Ensuring data quality through checks for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.</li><li>Feature Engineering — Creating customer-level attributes such as purchase frequency, recency, product mix, and discount sensitivity.</li><li>Exploratory Analysis — Identifying churn-related behavioral patterns and purchase trends.</li><li>Model Training &amp; Evaluation — Training supervised learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression) to predict churn probability.</li><li>Deployment &amp; Monitoring — Integrating predictions into business workflows and monitoring model performance over time.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Churn management is critical in B2B CPG markets where customer acquisition costs are high, and relationships often span years. Early detection of at-risk customers allows distributors to implement retention strategies such as targeted discounts, personalized offers, or improved service. This project provides actionable insights that directly link data-driven decision-making with business continuity.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Reduce revenue loss by retaining high-value customers.</li><li>Operational: Improve distributor–customer engagement strategies and resource allocation.</li><li>Strategic: Strengthen long-term customer relationships and maintain competitive advantage.</li><li>Predictive Advantage: Anticipate churn behavior instead of reacting to lost customers.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>A churn prediction model with measurable accuracy and recall rates.</li><li>Identification of key churn drivers (e.g., declining purchase frequency, heavy reliance on discounts).</li><li>Customer churn risk scores at the distributor–customer level.</li><li>Business dashboards highlighting churn trends and at-risk segments.</li><li>A framework for ongoing monitoring and retraining of the churn model.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
