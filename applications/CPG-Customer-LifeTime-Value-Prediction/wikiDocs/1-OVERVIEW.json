  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The primary objective of this project is to predict the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) customers using historical sales transaction data. CLV estimation enables the business to identify high-value customers, prioritize customer retention strategies, and allocate marketing budgets effectively. The project addresses the critical business problem of maximizing long-term profitability by differentiating customers based on their future revenue potential rather than short-term purchase behavior.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The project will follow a systematic data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Ingestion &amp; Profiling: Collect and understand sales transaction data, including customer IDs, invoices, products, and prices.</li><li>Data Preparation: Clean, transform, and engineer features relevant to CLV calculation (e.g., Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value).</li><li>Feature Engineering: Develop RFM metrics, customer purchase intervals, and retention indicators.</li><li>Model Training: Train predictive models (e.g., BG/NBD with Gamma-Gamma or Gradient Boosted Regressors) to estimate CLV.</li><li>Evaluation: Assess models using appropriate metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² for regression accuracy.</li><li>Deployment &amp; Insights: Deploy the model in a business-friendly interface and provide actionable insights for customer segmentation and targeted campaigns.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>This project is highly significant as it allows businesses to move beyond reactive sales strategies and adopt customer-centric, data-driven approaches. By knowing the predicted lifetime value of each customer, organizations can:</p><ul><li>Allocate resources to the most profitable customers.</li><li>Design personalized promotions.</li><li>Reduce churn by identifying at-risk but valuable customers.</li><li>Enhance overall marketing ROI.</li></ul><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Increase in long-term revenue through retention of high-value customers.</li><li>Operational: Improved targeting reduces wasted marketing spend.</li><li>Strategic: Establishes a data-driven framework for customer relationship management.</li><li>Customer-centricity: Strengthens customer loyalty through tailored experiences.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Development of a robust CLV prediction model.</li><li>Segmentation of customers into value tiers (e.g., high, medium, low CLV).</li><li>Clear insights into key drivers of CLV.</li><li>Actionable recommendations for retention and acquisition strategies.</li><li>Visual dashboards for business stakeholders to track CLV over time.</li></ul>",
