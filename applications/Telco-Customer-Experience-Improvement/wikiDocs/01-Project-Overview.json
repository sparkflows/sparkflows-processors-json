  "content": "<h1>Telco Customer Experience Improvement</h1><h2>Project Overview</h2><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p><p><strong> The project aims to predict the best alternative cell tower</strong> for load diversion when an existing tower experiences an outage or fault. By leveraging connectivity patterns, distance, and performance history, the solution enables telecom providers to maintain uninterrupted service and <strong>improve customer experience</strong>.</p><p><strong>Approach:</strong></p><p><strong> The methodology combines spatial and network-based analytics:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Neighbor Identification</strong> â Find adjacent cell towers based on geographic distance.</li><li><strong>Connectivity Analysis</strong> â Evaluate neighboring towers based on historical connectivity and dropped call counts.</li><li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong> â Incorporate additional metrics such as signal strength, network load, and call success rates.</li><li><strong>Model Training</strong> â Train a <strong>linear optimization model</strong> that balances distance minimization with call quality maximization.</li><li><strong>Model Evaluation &amp; Deployment</strong> â Validate predictions using connectivity success rates and deploy in real-time for tower outage scenarios.</li></ol><p><strong>Significance:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensures <strong>seamless connectivity</strong> during tower failures or maintenance.</li><li>Enhances <strong>customer satisfaction</strong> by reducing dropped calls.</li><li>Supports <strong>network resiliency</strong> by automating fallback tower selection.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Improved Call Quality:</strong> Reliable alternative tower selection reduces disruptions.</li><li><strong>Higher Customer Retention:</strong> Better service quality enhances customer loyalty.</li><li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Automated diversion reduces manual intervention in network management.</li><li><strong>Proactive Network Management:</strong> Predictive insights improve network planning and capacity allocation.</li></ul><p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong></p><ul><li>Accurate prediction of the most suitable neighboring tower.</li><li>Analytical dashboards showing tower connectivity relationships and diversion outcomes.</li><li>Optimized call success rates during outages, contributing to better <strong>customer experience KPIs</strong>.</li></ul>",
