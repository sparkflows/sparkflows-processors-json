Understanding the impact of SDOH can help healthcare providers (HCPs) improve engagement with patients by tailoring care and outreach programs.</p><p>HCP Engagement Prediction aims to forecast how actively healthcare providers engage with patients, based on the SDOH data. This predictive model helps identify gaps in healthcare access and the likelihood of future healthcare needs.</p><p><br></p><h2>Objective:</h2><p>To forecast healthcare provider (HCP) engagement levels with patients by leveraging insights from Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) data.</p><p> The project aims to identify healthcare access gaps, anticipate future patient needs, and support proactive interventions that improve overall health outcomes.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>Approach</h2><h3>1. Understanding SDOH Data</h3><ul><li>Key non-medical factors analyzed:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Economic stability</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Education level</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Social and community context</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Access to healthcare</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Environmental conditions</li></ul><h3>2. Predictive Modeling</h3><ul><li>Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature scaling.</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify correlations and patterns between SDOH factors and HCP engagement.</li><li>Model Development: Train and validate ML models to classify engagement levels (High, Moderate, Low).</li><li>Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to assess robustness.</li></ul><h3>3. Insights for Action</h3><ul><li>Provide actionable insights to healthcare providers and systems.</li><li>Recommend targeted strategies to improve patient engagement and healthcare delivery.</li></ul><h2><br></h2><h2>Significance</h2><ul><li>Targeted Interventions: Tailored outreach programs for vulnerable groups, ensuring equitable access to care.</li><li>Improved Engagement: Proactively address barriers (transportation, language, economic challenges).</li><li>Resource Optimization: Enable efficient allocation of resources to areas with the greatest need.</li></ul><h2><br></h2><h2>Expected Outcomes</h2><ul><li>A reliable predictive model to classify HCP engagement levels using SDOH data.</li><li>Actionable recommendations to bridge gaps in patient engagement and improve outcomes.</li><li>Deeper understanding of how SDOH influence healthcare engagement, guiding policy and resource allocation.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>This project highlights the importance of leveraging data analytics and machine learning to address critical challenges in healthcare delivery, fostering better engagement, equity, and outcomes in patient care.</p>",
