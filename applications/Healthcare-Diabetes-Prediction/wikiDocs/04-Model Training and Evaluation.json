Data Preprocessing</h3><ul><li>Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct inconsistencies.</li><li>Feature Engineering: Create derived features, encode categorical variables, normalize/standardize if required.</li><li>Train-Test Split: Partition dataset into training and testing subsets for unbiased evaluation.</li></ul><h3>2. Model Training (Random Forest Classifier)</h3><ul><li>Train Random Forest with multiple Decision Trees built on random data/feature subsets.</li><li>Tune hyperparameters:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Number of trees</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Maximum tree depth</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Number of features per split</li><li>Advantages leveraged:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Handles non-linear feature relationships</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Effective with missing data</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging</li></ul><h3>3. Model Evaluation</h3><ul><li>Accuracy → Correct predictions over total instances.</li><li>Precision, Recall, F1-score → Balance between false positives and false negatives.</li><li>Confusion Matrix → True positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives.</li><li>Cross-Validation (k-fold) → Ensures robustness across different splits.</li><li>ROC-AUC Curve → Measures classification performance across thresholds.</li></ul><h2>Significance</h2><p>Random Forest improves accuracy and generalization by combining multiple trees, making it more robust against overfitting than individual Decision Trees.</p><p><br></p><h2>Expected Outcomes</h2><ul><li>A high-performing diabetes prediction model with reliable accuracy and generalization.</li><li>Better identification of individuals at risk of diabetes for timely medical intervention.</li></ul><h2>Practical Applications</h2><ul><li>Healthcare → Early diabetes risk detection and preventive treatment planning.</li><li>Other Domains → Image recognition, customer segmentation, risk assessment, and any scenario needing accuracy and robustness with noisy/high-dimensional data.</li><li><br></li></ul>",
