This app allows users to explore loan data, build predictive models, and perform predictions. Hereâs a breakdown of each main stage in this app and what it accomplishes.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>1. Data Exploration (EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis)</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This stage helps users understand and analyze loan data before any prediction or modeling. By exploring the data, users can identify patterns, trends, and outliers that may impact the predictive models.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Filter Loan Data</strong>: Users can filter data based on various loan characteristics such as:</li><li>Loan Status (e.g., âCharged Off,â âCurrentâ)</li><li>Employment Length (e.g., â1 year,â â10+ yearsâ)</li><li>Home Ownership (e.g., âRent,â âMortgageâ)</li><li>Verification Status (e.g., âVerified,â âNot Verifiedâ)</li><li><strong>Visual Analysis</strong>: The app generates graphs and charts based on the filtered data, helping users see patterns visually. For example, they may observe that loans for individuals with shorter employment histories tend to have higher risk.</li><li><strong>Interactive Exploration</strong>: By adjusting different filters, users can focus on specific subsets of data to gain insights into factors that may affect loan default rates.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>2. Model Training for Credit Risk Prediction</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: Once users understand the data through EDA, the next step is to train predictive models. These models can later be used to make predictions about future loans and assess the risk associated with each one.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Actionable Options</strong>:</li><li><strong>Select Training Inputs</strong>: Users choose specific loan features (e.g., loan status, employment length) to customize the dataset used for training.</li><li><strong>Select Features for Modeling</strong>: Users choose variables, like annual income or debt-to-income ratio, that are relevant to the model. Selecting relevant features improves model accuracy.</li><li><strong>Select Model Type</strong>: Users select from three credit risk measures:</li><li><strong>LGD (Loss Given Default)</strong>: Predicts the potential financial loss if a borrower defaults.</li><li><strong>EAD (Exposure at Default)</strong>: Predicts the amount outstanding if a borrower defaults.</li><li><strong>PD (Probability of Default)</strong>: Predicts the likelihood that a borrower will default.</li><li><strong>LGD Stage Selection</strong>:</li><li><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Uses an XGBoost model, suitable for capturing complex relationships in the data.</li><li><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Uses a simpler, linear model (GLM), which is useful for data with straightforward patterns.</li><li><strong>Initiate Training</strong>: Users click a button to start the training process. The app uses the selected data to build and save models, which are ready for making future predictions.</li></ul><h4>Why Model Training is Important:</h4><p>Training is essential because it allows the app to âlearnâ from past loan data. By studying patterns from previous borrowers, the model can recognize high-risk or low-risk loans, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>3. Credit Risk Prediction Stage</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: After the models are trained, this stage uses those models to make predictions on new loan data. This allows users to assess the risk level of new or existing loans based on what the model has learned.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Upload New Data</strong>: Users can upload a new dataset for which they want to predict credit risk.</li><li><strong>View Dataset Details</strong>: Before running predictions, users can review the dataset to ensure it matches the structure used in training (e.g., same fields and formats).</li><li><strong>Run Prediction</strong>: Users select the type of prediction they want to run (e.g., LGD, EAD, or PD). The app uses the trained model to analyze the new data and generate risk predictions.</li><li><strong>View Prediction Results</strong>: The app displays the results, showing different metrics like the risk level for each loan. It also provides charts that visualize the risk distribution and characteristics of the loans.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>4. Model Accuracy Check</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This stage evaluates how well the model performed by checking its accuracy. Ensuring that models are accurate is crucial for making reliable predictions.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Run Accuracy Check</strong>: The app tests the model against known data to measure how close the predictions were to actual outcomes.</li><li><strong>Accuracy Score</strong>: It provides an accuracy score or metric, allowing users to understand the modelâs reliability.</li></ul><h4>Why Accuracy Check is Important:</h4><p>This step confirms that the model can make reliable predictions. If the accuracy is low, adjustments can be made to improve the model before using it on real loan data.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>5. Advanced Model Stages (LGD Stage 2 and EAD Modeling)</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: These stages build more advanced models for further precision in predicting loss (LGD Stage 2) and exposure at default (EAD). These stages improve the modelâs ability to estimate different aspects of credit risk.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Stage 2 Modeling</strong>: Builds another layer of model for LGD, enhancing the overall prediction by combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 results.</li><li><strong>EAD Modeling</strong>: Trains a model specifically to predict exposure at default, providing insights on potential financial exposure if a borrower defaults.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>6. Probability of Default (PD) Modeling</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This stage builds a model specifically to calculate the probability of a loan defaulting. PD is a key metric in credit risk assessment.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>PD Model Training</strong>: The app trains a model based on historical loan data to predict the likelihood of default.</li><li><strong>Prediction</strong>: This model can be used to predict PD on new loans, helping identify high-risk loans with a higher probability of default.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>7. Combining Predictions and Calculating Expected Loss</strong></h3><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This final stage combines all the predictions (LGD, EAD, and PD) to calculate the expected loss. Expected loss helps financial institutions understand the potential impact of lending decisions.</p><h4>Key Features:</h4><ul><li><strong>Combine Predictions</strong>: The app multiplies the predictions from LGD and EAD models to calculate a combined recovery rate.</li><li><strong>Expected Loss Calculation</strong>: By using all three risk measures (LGD, EAD, PD), the app calculates an expected loss value, summarizing the potential financial risk for each loan.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>The <strong>Credit Risk Prediction and Model Building Analytical App</strong> is a comprehensive tool for assessing credit risk in loan portfolios. It guides users through:</p><ol><li><strong>Data Exploration</strong>: Understanding loan data.</li><li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Building predictive models tailored to different risk metrics.</li><li><strong>Credit Risk Prediction</strong>: Applying trained models to assess new data.</li><li><strong>Accuracy Check</strong>: Verifying model reliability.</li><li><strong>Advanced Modeling</strong>: Refining models with advanced algorithms.</li><li><strong>Probability of Default Modeling</strong>: Predicting likelihood of defaults.</li><li><strong>Expected Loss Calculation</strong>: Combining predictions for a complete risk assessment.</li></ol><p>Through this app, financial institutions can make data-driven decisions, reduce financial risk, and effectively manage their lending portfolio.</p>",
