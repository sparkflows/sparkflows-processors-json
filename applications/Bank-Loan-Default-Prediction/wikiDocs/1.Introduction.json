  "content": "<h2>Bank Loan Default Prediction Solution</h2><h2>&nbsp;Project Overview</h2><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p><p> The goal of this project is to predict whether a bank customer is likely to default on their loan. By analyzing historical loan application data and repayment behaviors, the system provides an accurate probability of default. This enables financial institutions to make <strong>data-driven lending decisions</strong>, reduce non-performing assets (NPAs), and improve portfolio risk management.</p><p><strong>Approach:</strong></p><p> The workflow integrates a complete machine learning lifecycle:</p><ol><li><strong>Data Profiling &amp; EDA</strong> – Understand the structure, balance of default vs. non-default cases, and key risk indicators.</li><li><strong>Data Preparation</strong> – Clean missing values, encode categorical variables, and engineer features relevant to loan repayment.</li><li><strong>Model Training &amp; Validation</strong> – Train supervised models (e.g., H2O Distributed Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) to predict default probability.</li><li><strong>Evaluation &amp; Insights</strong> – Validate models using accuracy, recall, precision, F1, and ROC-AUC. Select the best-performing model for deployment.</li><li><strong>Deployment</strong> – Enable prediction of default risk for new applicants and generate portfolio-level default probability distributions.</li></ol><p><strong>Significance:</strong></p><p> Loan defaults significantly affect a bank’s profitability and stability. Early prediction of risky borrowers allows proactive steps such as:</p><ul><li>Adjusting loan terms (interest rate, tenure).</li><li>Improving approval/denial decisions.</li><li>Optimizing capital allocation and reserves.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Reduced loan loss provisions.</li><li>Improved profitability through better credit risk decisions.</li><li>Stronger compliance with regulatory capital adequacy norms.</li><li>Enhanced competitiveness through optimized lending strategies.</li></ul><p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong></p><ul><li>A trained predictive model that classifies customers as <strong>Default / Non-Default</strong>.</li><li>Insights into the most important features driving defaults (e.g., income, loan amount, credit history).</li><li>Portfolio-level default risk summaries for better capital management.</li></ul>",
