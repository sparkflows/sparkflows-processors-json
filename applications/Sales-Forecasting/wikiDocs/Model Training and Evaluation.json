By leveraging historical sales and external influencing factors such as holidays, promotions, and economic indicators, the model aims to generate accurate weekly sales predictions. These forecasts support demand planning, inventory optimization, and marketing decision-making, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency in retail settings.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">Expected Outcomes:</strong></h3><ul><li>A highly accurate sales forecasting model capable of generalizing across time and store-department combinations.</li><li>Identification of top predictive features, helping retailers understand key sales drivers (e.g., holidays, markdowns, seasonality).</li><li>Integration-ready predictions to support supply chain, merchandising, and marketing teams in planning and execution.</li></ul><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">Practical Applications:</strong></h3><ul><li>Forecast sales to optimize inventory levels and reduce stockouts or overstock.</li><li>Support promotional planning and pricing strategies based on expected sales uplift.</li><li>Assist in labor and logistics resource allocation by predicting high-demand periods.</li><li>Enable regional planning by forecasting demand at the store level with economic and demographic insights.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
