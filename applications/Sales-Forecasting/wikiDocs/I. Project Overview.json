  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The objective of this project is to develop a sales forecasting system that predicts weekly sales across multiple stores and departments. This initiative aims to answer the critical business question: “How can we accurately forecast future sales to improve inventory planning, optimize promotions, and enhance overall operational efficiency?” By leveraging historical sales data alongside external factors such as holidays, economic indicators, fuel prices, and store characteristics, the project will provide actionable insights for demand planning and business decision-making.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The project will follow a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Collection &amp; Integration: Consolidate historical sales, store attributes, and external economic/environmental factors.</li><li>Data Preparation: Clean missing values, handle outliers, encode categorical variables, and engineer time-based and holiday-related features.</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Profile the dataset to identify sales trends, holiday impacts, and store/department variations.</li><li>Model Development: Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, Prophet, or XGBoost) to forecast weekly sales.</li><li>Evaluation &amp; Validation: Assess models using regression metrics such as RMSE and MAPE to ensure accuracy and robustness.</li><li>Deployment &amp; Monitoring: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time forecasting and monitor its performance over time.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Sales forecasting is critical in retail and CPG operations. Accurate predictions allow businesses to reduce excess inventory costs, prevent stockouts, optimize promotions, and align supply chain planning with consumer demand. It also enhances customer satisfaction by ensuring availability of products during peak demand periods such as holidays.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Reduction in lost sales due to stockouts and lower holding costs from overstocking.</li><li>Operational: Improved workforce scheduling, inventory replenishment, and supply chain alignment.</li><li>Strategic: Enhanced promotional planning and better negotiation with distributors and suppliers.</li><li>Customer-centric: Consistent product availability improves customer satisfaction and loyalty.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Weekly sales forecasts at store-department level with high accuracy.</li><li>Identification of the impact of holidays, markdowns, and external economic factors on sales.</li><li>A ranked list of most influential features driving sales performance.</li><li>A deployable forecasting model integrated into the business workflow for decision support.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
