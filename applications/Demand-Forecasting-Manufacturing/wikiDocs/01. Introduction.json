  "content": "<p>Objective:</p><p> The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust demand forecasting system for the manufacturing sector. By leveraging historical sales data across product categories and items, the project aims to accurately predict future product demand. This will help manufacturers optimize production planning, inventory management, and supply chain operations. The key business problem being addressed is the misalignment between supply and demand, which can lead to stockouts, excess inventory, and increased operational costs.</p><p>Approach:</p><p> The project follows a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Collection &amp; Understanding – Analyze historical product demand records.</li><li>Data Preparation – Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling duplicates, missing values, and anomalies.</li><li>Feature Engineering – Extract relevant features such as time-based variables (day, month, seasonality) and product attributes.</li><li>Model Selection &amp; Training – Apply a time series forecasting model tailored for manufacturing demand prediction.</li><li>Model Evaluation – Use appropriate statistical and forecasting accuracy metrics to validate model performance.</li><li>Deployment &amp; Monitoring – Deploy the model in a production environment and continuously monitor forecast accuracy.</li></ol><p>Significance:</p><p> Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for manufacturing companies, as it directly impacts production scheduling, workforce planning, raw material procurement, and logistics. A reliable forecasting model minimizes uncertainty, reduces costs, and ensures timely delivery of products to customers.</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Improved production efficiency by aligning supply with anticipated demand.</li><li>Reduction in excess inventory holding costs.</li><li>Minimized stockouts and improved customer satisfaction.</li><li>Enhanced supply chain agility through data-driven planning.</li><li>Strategic insights for long-term business planning and expansion.</li></ul><p>Expected Outcomes:</p><ul><li>A trained forecasting model capable of generating accurate demand predictions at product and category levels.</li><li>Quantifiable improvements in forecast accuracy measured through statistical metrics.</li><li>Actionable dashboards and reports that enable decision-makers to adjust production and inventory plans.</li><li>Reduction in inventory-related losses and operational inefficiencies.</li></ul>",
