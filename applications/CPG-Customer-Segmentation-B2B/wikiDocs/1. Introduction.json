  "content": "<h3>Objective</h3><p>The objective of this project is to segment B2B customers of Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) distributors based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and product preferences. The core business problem being addressed is the lack of tailored engagement strategies for B2B customers. By grouping customers into distinct segments, distributors and sales teams can:</p><ul><li>Identify high-value customers.</li><li>Understand purchasing trends by sector, category, and geography.</li><li>Optimize promotions, discounts, and product bundling.</li><li>Improve customer retention through targeted strategies.</li></ul><h3>Approach</h3><p>The project will follow a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Collection &amp; Integration – Combine customer, sales, product, and distributor datasets.</li><li>Data Preparation &amp; Feature Engineering – Clean, transform, and enrich data with features such as average purchase frequency, spend, discounts availed, and product category preferences.</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Profile customers across geographies, product categories, and sales trends.</li><li>Segmentation Modeling – Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group customers.</li><li>Evaluation &amp; Validation – Assess segment quality using metrics such as Silhouette Score and intra-cluster vs inter-cluster variance.</li><li>Insights &amp; Deployment – Generate actionable reports and visualizations for business teams.</li></ol><h3>Significance</h3><p>Segmentation enables CPG distributors to transition from generic sales strategies to precision-driven customer engagement. It ensures that marketing and supply chain decisions are data-driven rather than intuition-based, fostering efficiency and profitability.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><ul><li>Financial: Optimize discounts, promotions, and inventory allocation to maximize revenue.</li><li>Operational: Enhance distribution planning by understanding demand by customer segment.</li><li>Strategic: Identify growth opportunities in underpenetrated segments and geographies.</li><li>Customer-centric: Build stronger distributor-customer relationships by offering tailored solutions.</li></ul><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Segmentation of customers into 3–6 distinct clusters based on purchasing and demographic attributes.</li><li>Identification of top-spending and discount-sensitive customer groups.</li><li>Insights into product category affinity by segment (e.g., wipes vs diapers).</li><li>Actionable recommendations for pricing, promotions, and sales prioritization.</li></ul>",
