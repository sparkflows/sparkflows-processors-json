  "content": "<h1>Fraudulent Transaction Anomaly Detection</h1><p><br></p><p>Objective:</p><p> The goal of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing invoice and vendor data. Using anomaly detection and explainable AI, the system flags suspicious activities, identifies root causes, and provides actionable insights to reduce fraud risks and financial losses.</p><p><br></p><p>Approach:</p><ul><li>Apply Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in transactional data.</li><li>Use SHAP feature contributions to explain fraud predictions in plain English (e.g., overbilling, ghost hours, price inflation, vendor collusion).</li><li>Generate structured Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and actionable insights for each anomaly.</li><li>Store anomaly results in SQL tables for persistence, retrieval, and editing by business users.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Significance:</p><ul><li>Fraud Risk Reduction: Early detection of fraudulent transactions prevents financial losses.</li><li>Transparency &amp; Explainability: SHAP-based explanations make fraud insights clear and business-friendly.</li><li>Operational Efficiency: Automates fraud triage, helping compliance and customer service teams act faster.</li><li>Governance &amp; Control: Ensures auditability and consistent fraud detection workflows.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>ï»¿Expected Outcomes:</p><ul><li>Accurate detection of anomalous invoices and suspicious vendor behaviors.</li><li>RCA and insights that guide business teams toward preventive actions (e.g., cross-verifying bank accounts, tightening approval workflows, monitoring vendor concentration).</li><li>Structured fraud reports with anomaly scores, stored in SQL for review and monitoring.</li><li>A scalable, AI-driven fraud detection assistant that improves financial security and compliance.</li><li>This project combines anomaly detection with explainable AI to create a fraud monitoring and prevention system. The outcome is not just anomaly flags, but business-ready insights that help organizations reduce fraud, strengthen internal controls, and protect revenue.</li></ul>",
