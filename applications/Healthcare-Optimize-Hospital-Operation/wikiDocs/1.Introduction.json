Key features included:</p><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Ward Type (General, Semi-private, Private, ICU).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Severity of Illness (Mild, Moderate, Severe).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Admission Deposit (initial patient deposit amount).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Patient Demographics (age, gender, region, insurance status).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Hospital Resources (bed availability, medical staff allocation, treatment type).</li></ul><p>\t\t\t2.Model Development</p><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Built predictive models using H2O AutoML framework, focusing on:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">H2O XGBoost → gradient boosting model for handling non-linear patterns.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">H2O Distributed Random Forest (DRF) → robust ensemble model for scalable prediction.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Tuned hyperparameters for depth, number of trees, learning rate, and sample ratios.</li></ul><p>\t3.Prediction Target</p><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Patient Stay Duration: Predicted as a categorical variable (e.g., <em>Short Stay, Medium Stay, Long Stay</em>) or as a continuous variable (exact number of days).</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3> Significance</h3><ul><li>Operational Efficiency: Accurate stay predictions improve bed management and staff allocation.</li><li>Patient Outcomes: Ensures patients receive timely care with optimized hospital workflows.</li><li>Cost Reduction: Reduces unnecessary occupancy, optimizing hospital costs.</li><li>Strategic Planning: Supports hospital administrators in forecasting demand and planning resources.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3> Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Accurate predictions of patient stay duration using H2O XGBoost and H2O DRF models.</li><li>Data-driven decision support for hospital administrators.</li><li>Improved patient satisfaction through timely treatment and efficient hospital operations.</li><li>Reduced hospital costs via optimized resource utilization and occupancy management.</li><li><br></li></ul><p><br></p><p>This project leverages the power of H2O XGBoost and H2O Distributed Random Forest models to address the challenge of predicting patient stay in hospitals, with the aim of optimizing hospital operations and improving overall patient care.</p>",
