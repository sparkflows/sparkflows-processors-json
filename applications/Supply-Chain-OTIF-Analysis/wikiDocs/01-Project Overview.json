OTIF serves as a critical supply chain performance metric, ensuring deliveries meet promised schedules and include the correct items and quantities. A high OTIF score indicates operational excellence and customer satisfaction, while a low score highlights issues such as late shipments or incomplete orders that can negatively impact business outcomes.</p><p><br></p><h3> Approach</h3><ol><li>Data Preparation</li></ol><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Define the dataset and establish key OTIF measurement criteria.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Calculate time differences between critical stages (e.g., Purchase Order receipt, Material Dispatch, Material Arrival).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Extract relevant date and time components (e.g., lead times, delays, seasonality).</li></ul><p>       2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</p><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Perform statistical and visual analysis to uncover patterns in OTIF performance.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Identify common causes of delays, incomplete orders, and supply chain inefficiencies.</li></ul><p>       3.Machine Learning (ML) Model Development</p><ul><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Train predictive models to forecast delivery performance.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Use feature importance analysis to identify key drivers influencing OTIF deviations.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Generate recommendations to improve delivery consistency and efficiency.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3> Significance</h3><ul><li>Customer Satisfaction: Consistently meeting promised delivery timelines improves customer trust, loyalty, and repeat business.</li><li>Brand Reputation: Reliable, timely deliveries strengthen the companyâ€™s position as a dependable and customer-focused supplier.</li><li>Inventory Management: Accurate OTIF performance reduces excess inventory, prevents stockouts, and optimizes working capital.</li><li>Supplier Relationships: Achieving OTIF goals requires close supplier collaboration, leading to more reliable procurement and production cycles.</li><li>Data-Driven Insights: Monitoring OTIF metrics provides actionable intelligence to guide continuous improvement initiatives.</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3>Expected Outcomes</h3><ul><li>Accurate predictions of delivery timelines for inbound and outbound materials.</li><li>Identification of key factors (supplier delays, production bottlenecks, transportation issues) influencing OTIF performance.</li><li>Optimization recommendations to improve supply chain reliability, reduce costs, and enhance OTIF scores.</li></ul><p><br></p>",
