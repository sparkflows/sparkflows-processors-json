  "content": "<h2>Project Overview</h2><p>Objective:</p><p>The primary goal of this project is to measure and analyze price elasticity of demand for B2B customers across various product categories, distributors, and geographies. The project aims to quantify how changes in unit price affect sales volume (quantity sold) and revenue. By modeling elasticity at different levels (SKU, product category, distributor, customer), the business can design more effective pricing strategies, discount policies, and promotions.</p><p>Approach:</p><p>The methodology follows a structured data science workflow:</p><ol><li>Data Integration – Combine Customers, Products, Distributors, and Sales Transactions datasets.</li><li>Data Cleaning &amp; Preparation – Handle missing values, normalize pricing and discounts, and align time-series data by week.</li><li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Profile demand, pricing, and revenue patterns across products, distributors, and customers.</li><li>Model Development – Use econometric models (Log-Log regression) or machine learning models to estimate price elasticity of demand.</li><li>Evaluation &amp; Validation – Measure statistical robustness and ensure business interpretability of results.</li><li>Deployment – Provide insights via dashboards and reports for strategic and tactical decision-making.</li></ol><p>Significance:</p><p>Understanding price elasticity in a B2B context is critical because customer purchasing patterns are influenced not just by retail dynamics, but also by distributor contracts, negotiated discounts, and business cycles. This analysis enables the company to avoid revenue leakage, optimize margins, and tailor pricing at granular levels.</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Improved pricing strategies based on customer and product elasticity.</li><li>Higher revenue optimization by balancing margins and sales volumes.</li><li>Better inventory planning aligned with demand sensitivity to price changes.</li><li>Stronger negotiation power with distributors and customers backed by data-driven elasticity insights.</li><li>Strategic segmentation of customers by price sensitivity.</li></ul><p>Expected Outcomes:</p><ul><li>Elasticity coefficients for SKUs, categories, distributors, and customers.</li><li>Identification of highly elastic vs. inelastic products.</li><li>Customer-level elasticity profiles for personalized pricing strategies.</li><li>Predictive insights into revenue impact under different pricing scenarios.</li><li>Interactive dashboards summarizing elasticity findings.</li></ul>",
