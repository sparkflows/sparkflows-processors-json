Project Objective:</strong></h3><p>The primary objective of this project is to analyze store and product-level sales performance, identify potential inventory and sales issues, and propose strategies for optimizing stock levels and improving sales forecasting accuracy. The project focuses on detecting zero-sales days, out-of-stock (OOS) situations, sales forecasting, and gaps in the inventory management system, aiming to ensure better operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">2. Data Overview:</strong></h3><p>The project involves analyzing sales and inventory data across multiple stores and products. Key metrics being studied include:</p><ul><li>Total units sold by product and store.</li><li>Zero-sales days by product, store, and store-product combination.</li><li>Out-of-stock situations (when on-hand inventory falls below safety stock).</li><li>Phantom inventory (discrepancy between actual stock and tracked stock).</li><li>Daily sales and inventory trends.</li><li>Sales forecasting for upcoming periods.</li></ul><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">3. Key Analysis Sections:</strong></h3><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">3.1. Zero Sales Days Analysis:</strong></h4><p>This section focuses on understanding the frequency of zero sales across stores and products, which can help identify underperforming areas and possible stock issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Key Charts</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Count of Zero Sales Days (All Products) for each Store.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Count of Zero Sales Days by Product.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Zero Sales Days for Each Store-Product Combination.</li><li><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Stores with frequent zero-sales days, such as store 486 and 337, may indicate inventory issues or local demand problems.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Products like 110 and 83 have consistently high zero-sales days, indicating that either demand is low or stockouts are frequent.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Store-product combinations with high zero-sales days may need better stock allocation or demand forecasting improvements.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">3.2. Sales Performance Overview:</strong></h4><p>This section evaluates the total sales of products and stores to identify high-performing and low-performing areas.</p><ul><li><strong>Key Charts</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Total Units Sold by Store.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Total Units Sold by Product.</li><li><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Stores like 425 and 771 have the highest total sales, suggesting high customer footfall and demand. These stores may need higher inventory to meet demand.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Product 110 is the highest-selling product, while others (like 52 and 76) have lower sales, potentially indicating niche appeal or ineffective marketing.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Underperforming products or stores may benefit from targeted promotional strategies or better stock management to boost sales.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">3.3. Inventory and Stock Management:</strong></h4><p>This section highlights potential issues in stock management, including out-of-stock situations, phantom inventory, and the relationship between sales and stock levels.</p><ul><li><strong>Key Charts</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Day-wise Phantom Inventory Level (Gap between Actual and Tracked Inventory).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Day-wise Possible Out-of-Stock Situation (On-hand Inventory vs Safety Stock).</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Day-wise Sales and Inventory Level (Identifying OOS issues).</li><li><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Significant fluctuations in the phantom inventory chart suggest discrepancies between actual and tracked inventory, leading to potential mismanagement.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Multiple instances where on-hand inventory dips below safety stock reveal OOS situations, especially for high-demand products or stores.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Monitoring the daily sales and inventory trends allows for real-time identification of stockouts and helps in better inventory replenishment.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">3.4. Sales Forecasting:</strong></h4><p>The forecasting section provides insight into expected future demand, which helps in aligning stock levels and planning promotions.</p><ul><li><strong>Key Charts</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Total Sales Forecasting.</li><li><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Peaks in forecasted sales offer opportunities for increased inventory allocation in preparation for higher demand.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Periods of low predicted sales may indicate opportunities for markdowns or promotions to increase sales.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\">Accurate forecasting helps prevent both overstocking and understocking, ensuring smooth operations.</li></ul><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">4. Identified Issues and Challenges:</strong></h3><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">4.1. Zero Sales and Stockouts</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><p>Stores and products with frequent zero-sales days may indicate stockouts or insufficient customer demand. Persistent zero-sales days for specific products (e.g., product 110) need further investigation to determine whether itâ€™s due to stock unavailability or lack of interest.</p><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">4.2. Phantom Inventory</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><p>The gap between actual and tracked inventory suggests issues in inventory tracking systems, which could lead to poor inventory management. Addressing phantom inventory is critical to maintaining accurate stock levels and preventing discrepancies.</p><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">4.3. Out-of-Stock (OOS) Situations</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><p>Frequent OOS issues, where on-hand inventory dips below safety stock, indicate a need for improved replenishment processes. By addressing these gaps, stores can avoid lost sales and enhance customer satisfaction.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">5. Proposed Solutions:</strong></h3><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">5.1. Improved Inventory Management</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><ul><li><strong>Automate Inventory Tracking</strong>: Implement a more accurate, automated inventory tracking system to reduce phantom inventory and discrepancies.</li><li><strong>Replenishment Alerts</strong>: Introduce automatic replenishment alerts when stock levels approach safety stock to prevent OOS situations.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">5.2. Dynamic Sales Forecasting</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><ul><li><strong>Leverage Forecasting</strong>: Use the sales forecasting data to better align inventory with anticipated demand. High-demand products should be prioritized for restocking, and low-demand items should have reduced inventory to minimize overstock.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">5.3. Store and Product Optimization</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><ul><li><strong>Target Underperforming Stores/Products</strong>: Focus on improving performance in stores and products with high zero-sales days. Consider localized promotions or better inventory allocation for these areas.</li><li><strong>Optimize High-Demand Products</strong>: Increase stock availability and marketing for high-demand products and stores to prevent lost sales.</li></ul><h4><strong style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">5.4. Cross-functional Collaboration</strong><span style=\"color: rgb(161, 0, 0);\">:</span></h4><ul><li><strong>Collaboration Between Sales and Supply Chain</strong>: Encourage collaboration between the sales and supply chain teams to ensure that demand forecasting aligns with inventory management and replenishment cycles.</li><li><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: Set up dashboards and alerts to continuously monitor sales trends and inventory levels to react promptly to any emerging issues.</li></ul><h3><strong style=\"color: rgb(0, 102, 204);\">6. Conclusion:</strong></h3><p>This project provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, stock levels, and potential operational inefficiencies in a retail environment. By addressing key issues such as zero-sales days, phantom inventory, and out-of-stock situations, the business can optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and ultimately boost overall performance. Implementing the proposed solutions will help prevent stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and ensure that stores can meet customer demand effectively.</p>",
