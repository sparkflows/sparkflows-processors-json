h2: Trigger Next Pipeline Examples

h4: Example of Creating a Trigger Next Pipeline Node

{
"Select Pipeline": "DataProcessingPipeline"
}

h4: Explanation
* This example demonstrates how to create a Trigger Next DAG node that triggers the `DataProcessingPipeline` as the next pipeline to run.

h4: Usage
* Task ID: "trigger_next_pipeline_task"

h4: Additional Example of Creating a Trigger Next Pipeline Node with a Different Pipeline

{
"Select Pipeline": "ReportingPipeline"
}

h4: Explanation
* This example illustrates how to create a Trigger Next Pipeline node that triggers the `ReportingPipeline` instead, allowing for flexibility in the next pipeline execution.

h4: Usage
* Task ID: "trigger_another_pipeline_task"
