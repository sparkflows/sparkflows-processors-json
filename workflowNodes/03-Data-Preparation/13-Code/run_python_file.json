h2: Run Python File Node Example

Scenario:

Let's say you want to perform a custom data transformation that isn't available as a built-in node. You can write a Python script to implement the desired transformation and then use the Run Python File node to execute it.

Usage:

Place the Run Python File node: Position the node in your workflow where you want to execute the Python script.
Set the Python file path: Configure the node with the path to your Python script.
Run the workflow: When the workflow reaches the Run Python File node, the specified Python script will be executed.
