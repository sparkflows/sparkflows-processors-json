h2:Generate UID Node Details

This node Generates UID value for each row and adds it as a new column. UID value generated contains unique Index/Value for each row.

h4:Input
*   UID COLUMN NAME :- Enter name of the column to list the generated UID values in the outgoing Dataframe.

h4:Output
*   New output column would be added to the Outgoing Dataframe listing the generated UID values for each row.

h4:Incoming Dataframe

In this example we have considered an Incoming Dataframe with following rows:

PRD_CD    |    PRD_NAME          |    LIST_PRICE    |    TAX_AMT    |    DISCOUNT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P01       |    DRILL MACHINE     |    1000.0        |    100.0      |    50.0
P02       |    WEIGHING MACHINE  |    1500.0        |    200.0      |    150.0
P03       |    HAMMER            |    100.0         |    10.0       |    5.0

h4:Generate UID Node Configuration And Output

GenerateUID node is configured to generate UID for each row and add it as a new column [UID_VAL]. 
Outgoing Dataframe would be created as below with new column [UID_VAL] added to it:

PRD_CD    |    PRD_NAME          |    LIST_PRICE    |    TAX_AMT    |    DISCOUNT    |    UID_VAL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
P01       |    DRILL MACHINE     |    1000.0        |    100.0      |    50.0        |    0
P02       |    WEIGHING MACHINE  |    1500.0        |    200.0      |    150.0       |    1
P03       |    HAMMER            |    100.0         |    10.0       |    5.0         |    2
