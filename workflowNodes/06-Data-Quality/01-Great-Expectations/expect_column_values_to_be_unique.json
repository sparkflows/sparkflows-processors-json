h2:Example

h4:Incoming Dataframe

In this example we have considered a Incoming Dataframe with following rows:

EMP_CD    |    DEPT        |
--------------------------------------
E01       |    MARKETING   |
E02       |    MARKETING   |
E03       |    SALES       |
E04       |    ADMIN       |

h4:Configuration

Column Name   | Mostly  |
-------------------------
EMP_CD        |         |
DEPT          | 0.75    |           

The above setup would result in a status of `success: true` as both conditions are satisfied.
