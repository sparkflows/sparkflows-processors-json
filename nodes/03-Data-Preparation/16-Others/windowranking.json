start-details:

This node Generates a new Dataframe with Rank Column appended to the incoming Dataframe.

Rank Column is populated with value based on the Window Function selected.

start-examples:

Incoming Dataframe has following rows:

EMP_CD    |    EMP_NAME    |    DEPT    |    SALARY    |    AGE    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
E01       |    ANTHONY     |    HR      |    50000     |    40

h2: If WindowRanking node is configured as below:

PARTITIONBY      :     DEPT
ORDERBY          :     SALARY
WINDOW FUNCTION  :     RANK

then outgoing Dataframe would be created as below 
where incoming Dataframe is partitioned by [DEPT] and data is sorted by [SALARY] and [rank] column would be populated with rank value within a partition
if two or more rows have same [SALARY] value then they would be assigned same rank value and next row would be assigned with value as per the order within a partition:

EMP_CD    |    EMP_NAME    |    DEPT    |    SALARY    |    AGE    |    rank
