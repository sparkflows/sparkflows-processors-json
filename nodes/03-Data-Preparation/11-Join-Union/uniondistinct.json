h2: Union Distinct Node Details

* This node creates a new DataFrame by performing a DISTINCT on the result set, eliminating any duplicate rows.
* It can take two or more DataFrames as input.
* Data types of the column that you are trying to combine should match.
* This node combines the results of the incoming DataFrames to generate a single result set that contains the rows without any duplicates.

h4:Incoming Dataframe

1st Incoming Dataframe has the following rows:

EMP_CD    |    EMP_NAME    |    DEPT       
-------------------------------------------
E01       |    DAVID       |    HR         
E02       |    JOHN        |    SALES      
E03       |    MARTIN      |    MARKETING  
E04       |    TONY        |    MARKETING  

2nd Incoming Dataframe has the following rows:

EMP_CD    |    EMP_NAME    |    DEPT       
-------------------------------------------
E03       |    MARTIN      |    MARKETING  
E04       |    TONY        |    MARKETING

E06       |    ROSS        |    SALES

h4:Final Output

After execution of UnionDistinct node following outgoing Dataframe would be created after combining all rows from all input Dataframes and removing duplicate rows.
Outgoing Dataframe contains only distinct rows:

EMP_CD    |    EMP_NAME    |    DEPT       
-------------------------------------------
E01       |    DAVID       |    HR         
E02       |    JOHN        |    SALES      
E03       |    MARTIN      |    MARKETING  
E04       |    TONY        |    MARKETING  
E05       |    MARK        |    HR         
E06       |    ROSS        |    SALES
