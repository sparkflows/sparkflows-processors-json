start-details:

This node takes two Dataframes as input, compares them on specific columns and creates three Dataframes as output.

First Dataframe (A-B) is created with rows of 1st Dataframe in which values in the specified columns don't have matching entries in same set of columns in 2nd Dataframe.

Second Dataframe (B-A) is created with rows of 2nd Dataframe in which values in the specified columns don't have matching entries in same set of columns in 1st Dataframe.

Third Dataframe (A intersection B) is created with rows common in both incoming Dataframes in which values in the specified columns have matching entries in same set of columns.
