start-details:

This node splits the incoming DataFrame into two output DataFrames by applying the conditional logic.

end-details:

start-examples:

Incoming Dataframe has following rows:

CUST_CD   |   CUST_NAME   |   AGE   
------------------------------------
C01       |   MATT        |   50    
C02       |   LISA        |   45
C03       |   ROBIN       |   35
C04       |   MARCUS      |   30 

If SplitByExpression node is configured to split the incoming Dataframe into two Dataframes based on Expression [AGE > 40] 
then two outgoing Dataframes would be created as below:

h2:First Dataframe where [AGE] is greater than 40

CUST_CD   |   CUST_NAME   |   AGE   
------------------------------------
C01       |   MATT        |   50    
C02       |   LISA        |   45

h2:Second Dataframe where [AGE] is less than 40

CUST_CD   |   CUST_NAME   |   AGE   
------------------------------------
C03       |   ROBIN       |   35
C04       |   MARCUS      |   30
