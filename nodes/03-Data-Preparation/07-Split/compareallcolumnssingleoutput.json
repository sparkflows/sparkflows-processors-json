start-details:

This node takes two Dataframes as input and creates one outgoing Dataframes as an output based on the Compare Type selected to compare two incoming Dataframes.

If Compare Type is selected as LEFTDATAFRAME_EXCEPT_RIGHTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (A-B) 
and it consists of rows that are part of 1st incoming Dataframe but not present in 2nd Dataframe.

If Compare Type is selected as RIGHTDATAFRAME_EXCEPT_LEFTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (B-A) 
and it consists of rows that are part of 2nd incoming Dataframe but not present in 1st Dataframe.

If Compare Type is selected as LEFTDATAFRAME_INTERSECT_RIGHTDATAFRAME then outgoing Dataframe is created based on (A intersection B) 
and it consists of rows that are part of both incoming Dataframes.
