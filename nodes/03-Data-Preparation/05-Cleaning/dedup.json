start-details:

h2:Levenstein

The Levenshtein distance between two strings is defined as the minimum number of edits needed to transform one string into the other, with the allowable edit operations being insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

How many char you change to make two strings equal.


h2:JaroWinker

Jaro–Winkler distance for two strings is, the more similar the strings are. The Jaro–Winkler distance metric is designed and best suited for short strings such as person names. The score is normalized such that 0 equates to no similarity and 1 is an exact match.

Good for short words, typos and nikename.

h2: Fullmatch

Fullmatch distance for two strings is, how two strings are match exactly. The score is assigned such that 1 is for exact match and 0 is for not match.


h2:Jaccard

The Jaccard similarity measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the cardinality of the intersection of sets divided by the cardinality of the union of the sample sets. Suppose you want to find jaccard similarity between two sets A and B it is the ration of cardinality of A ∩ B and A ∪ B.

Sparkflows provide default 3-gram Jaccard similarity measures.


Longest common subsequences(LCS): LCS distance between strings s1 and s2, computed as |s1| +|s2| - 2 * |LCSfunction(s1, s2)| and distance is normalized between 0 and 1.

LCSfunction returns the length of Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between strings s1 and s2.



h2:Notional distance

Notional distance between two numbers X and Y, computed as  abs(X - Y) / abs(x) + abs(Y).

h2:Date Difference

Date Difference gives number of days between two dates(yyyy-MM-dd).

h2: Dedup Node Example

Given the following dataset:

PartID	SupplierID	PartName	PartCategory	PartQualityScore
A1	S1	Bolt	Hardware	8
B2	S2	Nut	Hardware	7
A1	S1	Bolt	Hardware	8
C3	S3	Screw	Hardware	9

If we configure the Dedup node to remove duplicates based on the following columns:

PartID
SupplierID
PartName
PartCategory
PartQualityScore
The resulting dataset would be:

PartID	SupplierID	PartName	PartCategory	PartQualityScore
A1	S1	Bolt	Hardware	8
B2	S2	Nut	Hardware	7
C3	S3	Screw	Hardware	9
