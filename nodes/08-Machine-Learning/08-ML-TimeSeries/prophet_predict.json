h2: Prophet Predict Node Details

This node generates predictions using a trained Prophet model. The output includes forecasted timestamps and associated values based on the time series data provided.

ds: Schema detail of the output DataFrame, representing timestamps.
Output Storage Level: Specifies the storage persistence level for the output DataFrame.

h2: Prophet Predict Node Examples

Example Configuration:

Output:

Given a trained Prophet model and an input DataFrame containing future timestamps, the node will output a DataFrame with the schema:

ds
timestamp
Example:

Input DataFrame with timestamps:

ds
2023-12-01
2024-01-01
2024-02-01
The node processes these timestamps and outputs the predictions based on the Prophet model, appending forecasted values to this structure.
