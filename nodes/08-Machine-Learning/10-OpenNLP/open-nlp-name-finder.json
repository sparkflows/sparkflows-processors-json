start-details:

This node performs  namefinder using OpenNLP to easily detect named entities and numbers in text.

To be able to detect entities the Name Finder needs a model. The model is dependent on the language and entity type it was trained for.

https://opennlp.apache.org/documentation/1.6.0/manual/opennlp.html#tools.namefind.recognition.cmdline

The OpenNLP project offers a number of pre-trained name finder models which are trained on various freely available corpora. They can be downloaded at the OpenNLP download page.
