This node represents Pipeline from Spark ML.

In machine learning, it is common to run a sequence of algorithms to process and learn from data. 
E.g., a simple text document processing workflow might include several stages:

* Split each document’s text into words.
* Convert each document’s words into a numerical feature vector.
* Learn a prediction model using the feature vectors and labels.

MLlib represents such a workflow as a Pipeline, which consists of a sequence of PipelineStages (Transformers and Estimators) to be run in a specific order.
