start-details:

this node saves the trained model in the file system at the specified path to be used again in future

end-details

start-examples:

path-folder1/folder2/filename
static path-true/false -keep it true then it overwrites if there is existing model at the path

the file will be saved under the file name at the path provided
if folder is not present it will be created and save the file
