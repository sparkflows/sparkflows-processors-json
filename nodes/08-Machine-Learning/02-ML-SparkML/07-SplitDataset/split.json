start-details:

This node splits the incoming DataFrame into 2. It takes in the fraction to use in splitting the data.

For example, if the fraction is .7, it would split the data into 2 DataFrames, one containing 70% of the rows(passed from lower edge id to next node) and the other containing the remaining 30%(passed from higher edge id to next node).

The split node can be used for splitting the DataFrame for training and test datasets used in Machine Learning.

start-examples:

lets say you pass a table with 5 rows and the fraction .6(60%),the first and second outcomes of the node will give dataframes as follows

First
PartID	SupplierID	PartName	
StringType	StringType	StringType	
P9271	S798	Part_D	
P523	S955	Part_K	
P3201	S332	Part_M	


Second
PartID	SupplierID	PartName	
StringType	StringType	StringType	
P9634	S527	Part_G	
P9345	S850	Part_M
