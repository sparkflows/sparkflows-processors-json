h2: MaxAbs Scaler Transform Node Details

The MaxAbs Scaler Transform Node is used to apply the MaxAbs scaler transformation on a given dataset. It takes in a fit MaxAbs scaler model as input, which has been trained on a dataset, and applies the same scaling on the input dataset. It is used for transforming new data after a model has been fit.
It takes in no input parameters as it requires a fit MaxAbs scaler model as input to perform the transformation.
