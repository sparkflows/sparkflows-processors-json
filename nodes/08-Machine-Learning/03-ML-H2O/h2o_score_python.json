h2: H2O Score Node Example

Scenario:

Let's say you have trained an H2O model to predict customer churn. You can use the H2O Score node to apply this model to a new dataset of customer data and generate churn predictions.

Configuration:

1. **H2O Model:** Select the trained H2O model to use for scoring from model load node
2. **Output Storage Level:** Choose the storage level for the output DataFrame.

Output:

The node will output a new DataFrame containing the original input data along with the predicted values.
