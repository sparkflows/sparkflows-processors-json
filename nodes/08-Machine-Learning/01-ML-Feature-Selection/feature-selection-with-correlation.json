h2: Feature Selection With Correlation Node Details

This node enables us to discover the possible correlation which can exist between a defined target column and the feature column's.

h4:Input Parameters
* OUTPUT STORAGE LEVEL : Keep this as DEFAULT.
* TARGETCOL : Select the target variable for which we want to explore the existence of a relationship.
* FEATURE COLUMNS : 
  - Available : A list of numeric feature columns derived from the input dataframe schema.
  - Selected : A list of columns for whom the node will compute correlational values against the TARGETCOL.

h2: Feature Selection With Correlation Node Example

For a given dataframe having the below housing schema:
price  | bathrms | stories| bedrooms|
Double | Double  | Double | Double  |
-------------------------------------

We can select the Target Columns as <b>price</b> and explore the correlation which exists between the target column and the feature columns of <b>bathrms</b>, <b>stories</b> and <b>bedrooms</b>.

This will yield two output sections:
- A Correlation table showing the correlation value between the target column price and the feature columns &
- Output of the input dataframe in tabular format
