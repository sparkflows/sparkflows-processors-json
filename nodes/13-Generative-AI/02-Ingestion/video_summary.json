<h2>Video Summarization Node Details</h2>
The Video Summarization node processes video files to generate a text summary of their content. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to analyze the video and produce a concise summary, which is saved as a text file at the specified output path. This node is designed for PySpark-based workflows, making it suitable for automated video content analysis in data pipelines.

<h4>General:</h4>
<h5>Select Connection:</h5> Specifies the connection details for the LLM (e.g., API key for the selected provider). This is required to authenticate and access the model used for summarization.

<h5>Select Video Path:</h5> Specifies the file path to the video file to be summarized. This field is required and must point to a valid video file accessible to the PySpark engine.

<h5>Select Summary Length:</h5> Specifies the desired number of words for the generated summary. This is optional; if left empty, the LLM uses a default length determined by the model.

<h5>Select Language:</h5> Specifies the language in which the summary should be generated. This is optional; if left empty, the default language (typically English) is used by the LLM.

<h5>Output Path:</h5> Specifies the file path where the generated summary will be saved as a .txt file. This is optional; if provided, the summary is saved to the specified location.

<h4>Output:</h4>
The node outputs the generated summary as a text file saved at the specified Output Path. The summary contains a concise description of the video content, formatted as plain text in the chosen language and adhering to the specified word count if provided.

<h2>Example: Video Summarization Node</h2>

<h3>Input:</h3>
A video file is located at:
- /data/videos/product_demo.mp4 (a 3-minute video demonstrating a new software product)

The Video Summarization node is configured as follows:
* Select Connection: Configured with a valid LLM API key (e.g., OpenAI)
* Select Video Path: /data/videos/product_demo.mp4
* Select Summary Length: 100
* Select Language: en
* Output Path: /data/output/summary.txt

<h3>Output:</h3>
The node processes the video file and generates a text file at /data/output/summary.txt with the following content:
- The video showcases a new software product, highlighting its user-friendly interface, key features like real-time analytics and collaboration tools, and its benefits for improving team productivity. The demo includes a walkthrough of the dashboard and integration capabilities.

<h3>Explanation:</h3>
- The product_demo.mp4 file is processed using the specified LLM connection to analyze its content and generate a summary.
- The Select Summary Length is set to 100 words, ensuring the summary is concise and approximately 100 words long.
- The Select Language is set to 'en' (English), so the summary is generated in English.
- The summary is saved as a .txt file at /data/output/summary.txt as specified in the Output Path.
- If Select Summary Length was left empty, the LLM would determine an appropriate length for the summary.
- If Select Language was left empty, the default language (English) would be used by the LLM.
