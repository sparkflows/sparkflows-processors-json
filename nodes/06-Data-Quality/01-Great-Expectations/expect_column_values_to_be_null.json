h2:Example

h4:Incoming Dataframe

In this example we have considered a Incoming Dataframe with following rows:

EMP_CD    |    DEPT        |
--------------------------------------
E01       |                |
E02       |                |
E03       |                |
E04       |                |

h4:Configuration #1

Column Name   | Mostly  |
-------------------------
EMP_CD        |         |

The above setup would result in a status of `success: false` as the condition is not satisfied.

h4:Configuration #2

Column Name   | Mostly  |
-------------------------
DEPT        |   0.9     |

The above setup would result in a status of `success: true` as the condition is satisfied.
